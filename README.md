1. [download Processing](https://processing.org/download/ "Download Processing")
1. open *pixel_flow.pde* with Processing and run it
1. select the image you would like to make its pixels flowing
1. hit <kbd>UP ARROW</kbd> to increase the width of the image by one, <kbd>DOWN ARROW</kbd> to decrease it by one, <kbd>RIGHT ARROW</kbd> to increase it by ten, <kbd>LEFT ARROW</kbd> to decrease it by ten
